If you are then you need to know if the company you are currently checking out actually offers the best value for your money.</p><h3>What is a Website Spokesperson?</h3><p>Video spokespeople are different from the auto-play videos that are in a box that you see in most websites. A virtual spokesperson is a border-less video of a person that seems to speak to the website visitor. These kinds of videos feature a transparent background to make it seem as if the person talking just popped out of the website and is walking around in front of the page. This kind of video will grab the attention of website visitors just long enough so they can explain your products or services much better.</p><h3>What options for virtual spokespersons are available?</h3><p>There are many companies that offer website spokesperson software where you can choose a model and provide your own script for them to recite. However, many companies charge a hefty price for their services, some reportedly charge more than $500 for a 30-second video clip. The good news is that you can shop around and actually find services that are much more affordable, but still provide quality virtual spokesperson videos for your website. </p><h3>Can a website spokesperson be added to any website?</h3><p>At the bare minimum you just need to be able to add a line of javascript to your page.  If your web hosting service allows you to load files onto the server then you can definitely place a website spokesperson on your home page with no problem. In fact, you do not have to write a single line of code, the company who does offers this kind of service will do all the work for you. </p><p>However, with that said, you should be wary of website spokesperson software that does not allow you to host your own video on your own server; there will be nothing you could do if they accidentally remove your video from their servers. Other warning signs to look out for is if they charge a monthly fee for their service; virtual spokesperson video making should only have a one-time fee, if they charge you for hosting the video then that company is not worth your time or money.</p><div style="width: 100%;max-width:1280px;margin:0 auto;padding:1rem">  <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">	  <a href="http://www.talkingheads.com/spokespeople">  <img src="http://seovideoexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/wp_image_duplicator_uploads/Virtual Actor.jpg" alt="Web Spokesperson"></a> </div></div><h3>Which companies provide the best quality videos and services?</h3><p>You need to do your homework and compare each potential virtual spokesperson company you find before you make a final choice. Do keep in mind that not just because one company charges a higher fee as the others, it automatically makes them better. </p><h3>Here are some of the key factors that you need to consider before settling on one website spokesperson service:</h3><ul>  <li>Are the presentations on the company’s own website clear and crisp?</li>  <li>Does the company charge a monthly fee or is there a one-time charge?</li>  <li>Does the company charge per word or per minute of video?</li>  <li>Is the work they did for their previous clients at par with your expectations of quality?</li></ul><p>You need to ask yourself these questions so you can gauge whether or not a particular website spokesperson software is worth your business. Once you do find a company that provides all of the things that you are looking for, then expect your sales to rise dramatically.
